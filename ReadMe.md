### Improvements that are possible
1 Renaming field name id to a more understandable postId or commentId.
2 Using maps instead of array.

### Boiler plate codes
The app was build with fluxible framework and boiler plate codes were generated.
Application.js,Html.js,Nav.js,server.js,webpack-dev-server.js are boiler plate. 
I had to modify them a little to suit my needs.
